<b style="background-color: lightgreen;color: brown; text-align: center; background-position: 330px;"><a name="sa"> The Cape County Resort - Cape Town, South Africa</a></b> 
<p>County Resort is the only luxury Cape Town hotel located within Table Mountain National Park:<br> at the base of precipitous Chapman's Peak, it is also the only hotel in the city that<br> is right on the beach and offers sublime ocean views, excellent food and authentic, warm service.</p>

<b>Facilities</b> 
<p>Fancy a day flopped by the pool? Grab your pool bag from the closet and get settled in;<br> there's even sunscreen and water to be sourced from the woven bags dotted around<br> the terrace. For those with a little more motivation, there's Virgin Active gym passes on offer from<br> reception, who are on-hand 24 hours a day - it's rather like having a brilliant concierge service.</p> 

<b>Food and drink</b>
<p>The breakfast at County Resort is quite possibly the best start to the day you might <br>ever have. Lavish (go for at least two courses), and also included in your room rate, it's served <br>at any time of day, and if you're feeling particularly lazy (or are still recovering from <br>a Table Mountain hike),  they're also happy to bring it to your room. There's a full bar service, <br>including a cocktail list and wine list, as well as a limited but seasonally based menu. </p>

<b>Extra-Curricular</b> 
<p>County Resort is ideally placed if you want to hit one of the Table Mountain trails early<br> doors, but make sure you keep an eye on the weather: brisk south-easterly winds <br>often usher in a fog-like blanket, the 'tablecloth' that settles along the flat top, and shuts down<br> the cable car that also shuttles people up and down. Sunrise hikes along Lion's Head, which <br>sits next to Table Mountain with views down the Atlantic Seaboard, are 'a must', according to locals. </p>
